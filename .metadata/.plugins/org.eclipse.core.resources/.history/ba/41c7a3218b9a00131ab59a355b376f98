# The following hash contains every field in a PID segment, with the index of the component it is in.
# Some of these contain multiple sub-components delimited with ^.
# I believe the abbreviations will be easier to use, which I why I went that way. Note that I devised the abbreviations;
#    they do not come from an external source.
# The full names of the fields are, in order:
#    
#    Patient ID (PID), External Patient ID (EXID), Internal Patient ID (INTID), Alternate Patient ID (ALTID),
#    Patient Name (NAME), Mother's Maiden Name (MMN), Date/Time of Birth (DOB), Sex (SEX), Patient Alias (ALS),
#    Race (RACE), Address (ADDR), Country Code (CCD), Home Phone Number (PHH), Business Phone Number (PHB),
#    Native Language (LNG), Marital Status (MAR), Religion (REL), Patient Account Number (ACCT), Social Security
#    Number (SSN), Driver's License Number (DLN), Mother's ID Number (MID), Ethnicity (ETH), Birthplace (POB),
#    Multiple Birth Indicator (MBI), Birth Order (BORD), Citizenship (CTZ), Veteran Status (VET), Nationality (NTL),
#    Date/Time of Death (DOD), Indication of Death (IOD)
