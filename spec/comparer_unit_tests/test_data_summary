The sample data set used for testing was strategically designed to cover the widest variety of test cases, while
still being small enough that the "correct answer" can be easily determined.

The following is meant to indicate what can be found in the set of test data provided (test_data.txt):

1. The records used are lab records

2. There are a total of 4 patients:
	Palmer^Lois^G
	Palmer^Lois^DUPLICATE
	Smith^John^W
	Palmer^Lois^REDUNDANT
	
3. There are a total of 6 criteria (defined in spec_helper.rb):
	:obx_potassium
    :obx_sodium
    :obx_chloride
    :obx_fake
    :male
    :female
    
4. Of the 6 criteria, 5 are matched by the records
	:obx_fake is not matched

5. Of the 4 records, 2 should be chosen by the (generic) RecordComparer:
	Smith^John^W
	either Palmer^Lois^G or Palmer^Lois^DUPLICATE

6. Palmer^Lois^G and Palmer^Lois^DUPLICATE are identical except for two things:
	the patient name (obviously)
	the patient MRN (see 9)
	
7. The records each match these criteria:
	Palmer^Lois^G                   =>  :obx_sodium, :obx_chloride, :female
	Palmer^Lois^DUPLICATE           =>  :obx_sodium, :obx_chloride, :female
	Smith^John^W                    =>  :obx_potassium, :obx_chloride, :male
	Palmer^Lois^REDUNDANT           =>  :obx_potassium, :female

From this it can be determined that Palmer^Lois^DUPLICATE and Palmer^Lois^G have dupliate criteria and
that Palmer^Lois^REDUNDANT is redundant (does not match any criteria that are not matched by other records)

8. There are two series records:
	Palmer^Lois^DUPLICATE
	Palmer^Lois^REDUNDANT
	
9. Of the 4 records, 3 should be chosen by the OrgSensitiveRecordComparer:
	Smith^John^W
	Palmer^Lois^G
	Palmer^Lois^DUPLICATE

Of the duplicate records, the SERIES one should be removed - this is Palmer^Lois^DUPLICATE (0% series)
The redundant record Palmer^Lois^REDUNDANT will then be removed (0% series)
Of the unused records, the SERIES one will be chosen - this is Palmer^Lois^DUPLICATE (33% series, but at least there's 1!)
