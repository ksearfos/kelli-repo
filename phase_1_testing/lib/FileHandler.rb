#
# MODULE: HL7
#
# CLASS: HL7::FileHandler
#
# DESC: Defines an object to read HL7 message from a file and split it into Message objects. Basically sets the stage
#         for treating the file text as a HL7 message.
#       Performs minor reformatting to insure there are no blank lines, and all line breaks are done with \n and not \r
#       The message handler class takes a filepath where HL7 data is stored, reads from it, and standardizes the format of
#         the text. It then breaks the text into individual records and initializes Message objects from those. It will also
#         keep track of each of those Messages and the value separators used by the message.
#       It is assumed that the file is in a valid text format and uses either the Windows-style line endings (\r and \r\n)
#         or the Unix style (\n). It also assumes the file is UTF-8 encoded.
#
# EXAMPLE: FileHandler => "MSH|...MSH|...MSH|..." / [ Message1, Message2, Message 3 ]
#
# CLASS VARIABLES: none; uses HL7::SEG_DELIM and modifies HL7.separators
#
# READ-ONLY INSTANCE VARIABLES:
#    @file_text [String]: stores entire message text
#    @messages [Array]: stores individual records as Message objects
#
# CLASS METHODS: none
#
# INSTANCE METHODS:
#    new(file,limit): creates new FileHandler object and reads in text from file, up to limit records (if specified)
#    to_s: returns String form of FileHandler, which is the text of the file
#    [](index): returns Message at given index
#    each(&block): loops through each record, executing given code
#    method_missing: tries to call method on @messages (Array)
#                    then tries to call method on @file_text (String)
#                    then gives up and throws exception
#    next: gets the next @max_records records and stores them in @records - @records will be empty if there were no more

    # DESC: creates a new HL7::FileHandler object from a text file
    # ARGS: 1-2
    #  file [String] - complete path to the source file
    #  limit [Integer] - highest number of records to read in from the source file - by default there is no limit
    # RETURNS:
    #  [HL7::FileHandler] newly-created FileHandler
    # EXAMPLE:
    #  HL7::FileHandler.new( "C:\records.txt", 2 ) => new FileHandler pointed to records.txt, with 2 records total

    # NAME: to_s
    # DESC: returns the message handler as a String object - basically the text of the file
    # ARGS: none 
    # RETURNS:
    #  [String] the message handler source in textual form
    # EXAMPLE:
    #  message_handler.to_s => "MSH|...MSH|...MSH|..."

    # NAME: []
    # DESC: returns record (Message object) at given index
    # ARGS: 1
    #  index [Integer] - the index of the record we want
    # RETURNS:
    #  [Message] an individual Message/record
    # EXAMPLE:
    #  message_handler[2] => Message3

    # DESC: performs actions for each record
    # ARGS: 1
    #  [code block] - the code to execute on each component
    # RETURNS: nothing, unless specified in the code block
    # EXAMPLE:
    #  message_handler.each{ |rec| print rec.id + " & " } => 12345 & 12458 & 12045

    # DESC: handles methods not defined for the class

    #  sym [Symbol] - symbol representing the name of the method called
    #  *args - all arguments passed to the method call
    #  [code block] - optional code block passed to the method call
    # RETURNS: depends on handling
    #     ==>  first checks @records for a matching method
    #     ==>  second checks @file_text for a matching method
    #     ==>  then gives up and throws an Exception
    # EXAMPLE:
    #  message_handler.size => 3 (calls @messages.size)
    #  message_handler.gsub( "*", "|" ) => "MSH*...MSH*...MSH*..."  (calls @file_text.gsub)
