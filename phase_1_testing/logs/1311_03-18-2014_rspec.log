OBX|1|TX|&GDT||Clinical Information: lung ca 162.9
2|TX|&GDT||HISTORY:  Lung carcinoma.
3|TX|&GDT|| 
4|TX|&GDT||CT OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST 05/04/2011:
5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT|| 
44|TX|&IMP||IMPRESSION:
45|TX|&IMP|| 
46|TX|&IMP||1.  Mild interval increase in size in dominant right lower lobe heterogeneously enhancing partially
47|TX|&IMP||necrotic mass consistent with lung carcinoma.
48|TX|&IMP||2.  Interval increase in both size and number of pulmonary metastatic deposits bilaterally.  The more
49|TX|&IMP||ill-defined ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and involving the lateral basilar segment
50|TX|&IMP||of the left lower lobe are nonspecific and may represent superimposed multifocal inflammatory or
51|TX|&IMP||infectious foci.
52|TX|&IMP||3.  Significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular and right lower neck lymphadenopathy.
53|TX|&IMP|| The previously identified mediastinal and hilar nodes have increased in both size and number.  The
54|TX|&IMP||large infiltrative subcarinal nodal mass has increased and cannot be separated from the esophagus.
55|TX|&IMP||4.  New right hepatic metastatic deposit.  The previously identified lesion closer to the liver dome is
56|TX|&IMP||unchanged compared to MRI study from 09/26/2009 and may represent hepatic hemangioma versus treated
57|TX|&IMP||metastatic deposit.  SKS/jas

5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small

5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the

4|TX|&GDT||CT OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST 05/04/2011:
5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.

4|TX|&GDT||CT OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST 05/04/2011:
5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT|| 
44|TX|&IMP||IMPRESSION:
45|TX|&IMP|| 
46|TX|&IMP||1.  Mild interval increase in size in dominant right lower lobe heterogeneously enhancing partially
47|TX|&IMP||necrotic mass consistent with lung carcinoma.
48|TX|&IMP||2.  Interval increase in both size and number of pulmonary metastatic deposits bilaterally.  The more
49|TX|&IMP||ill-defined ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and involving the lateral basilar segment
50|TX|&IMP||of the left lower lobe are nonspecific and may represent superimposed multifocal inflammatory or
51|TX|&IMP||infectious foci.
52|TX|&IMP||3.  Significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular and right lower neck lymphadenopathy.
53|TX|&IMP|| The previously identified mediastinal and hilar nodes have increased in both size and number.  The
54|TX|&IMP||large infiltrative subcarinal nodal mass has increased and cannot be separated from the esophagus.
55|TX|&IMP||4.  New right hepatic metastatic deposit.  The previously identified lesion closer to the liver dome is
56|TX|&IMP||unchanged compared to MRI study from 09/26/2009 and may represent hepatic hemangioma versus treated

4|TX|&GDT||CT OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST 05/04/2011:
5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT|| 
44|TX|&IMP||IMPRESSION:
45|TX|&IMP|| 
46|TX|&IMP||1.  Mild interval increase in size in dominant right lower lobe heterogeneously enhancing partially
47|TX|&IMP||necrotic mass consistent with lung carcinoma.
48|TX|&IMP||2.  Interval increase in both size and number of pulmonary metastatic deposits bilaterally.  The more
49|TX|&IMP||ill-defined ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and involving the lateral basilar segment
50|TX|&IMP||of the left lower lobe are nonspecific and may represent superimposed multifocal inflammatory or
51|TX|&IMP||infectious foci.
52|TX|&IMP||3.  Significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular and right lower neck lymphadenopathy.
53|TX|&IMP|| The previously identified mediastinal and hilar nodes have increased in both size and number.  The
54|TX|&IMP||large infiltrative subcarinal nodal mass has increased and cannot be separated from the esophagus.
55|TX|&IMP||4.  New right hepatic metastatic deposit.  The previously identified lesion closer to the liver dome is
56|TX|&IMP||unchanged compared to MRI study from 09/26/2009 and may represent hepatic hemangioma versus treated

4|TX|&GDT||CT OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST 05/04/2011:
5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT|| 
44|TX|&IMP||IMPRESSION:
45|TX|&IMP|| 
46|TX|&IMP||1.  Mild interval increase in size in dominant right lower lobe heterogeneously enhancing partially
47|TX|&IMP||necrotic mass consistent with lung carcinoma.
48|TX|&IMP||2.  Interval increase in both size and number of pulmonary metastatic deposits bilaterally.  The more
49|TX|&IMP||ill-defined ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and involving the lateral basilar segment
50|TX|&IMP||of the left lower lobe are nonspecific and may represent superimposed multifocal inflammatory or
51|TX|&IMP||infectious foci.
52|TX|&IMP||3.  Significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular and right lower neck lymphadenopathy.
53|TX|&IMP|| The previously identified mediastinal and hilar nodes have increased in both size and number.  The
54|TX|&IMP||large infiltrative subcarinal nodal mass has increased and cannot be separated from the esophagus.
55|TX|&IMP||4.  New right hepatic metastatic deposit.  The previously identified lesion closer to the liver dome is
56|TX|&IMP||unchanged compared to MRI study from 09/26/2009 and may represent hepatic hemangioma versus treated

4|TX|&GDT||CT OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST 05/04/2011:
5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT|| 
44|TX|&IMP||IMPRESSION:
45|TX|&IMP|| 
46|TX|&IMP||1.  Mild interval increase in size in dominant right lower lobe heterogeneously enhancing partially
47|TX|&IMP||necrotic mass consistent with lung carcinoma.
48|TX|&IMP||2.  Interval increase in both size and number of pulmonary metastatic deposits bilaterally.  The more
49|TX|&IMP||ill-defined ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and involving the lateral basilar segment
50|TX|&IMP||of the left lower lobe are nonspecific and may represent superimposed multifocal inflammatory or
51|TX|&IMP||infectious foci.
52|TX|&IMP||3.  Significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular and right lower neck lymphadenopathy.
53|TX|&IMP|| The previously identified mediastinal and hilar nodes have increased in both size and number.  The
54|TX|&IMP||large infiltrative subcarinal nodal mass has increased and cannot be separated from the esophagus.
55|TX|&IMP||4.  New right hepatic metastatic deposit.  The previously identified lesion closer to the liver dome is
56|TX|&IMP||unchanged compared to MRI study from 09/26/2009 and may represent hepatic hemangioma versus treated

6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT||

5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the

5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right

4|TX|&GDT||CT OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST 05/04/2011:
5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT|| 
44|TX|&IMP||IMPRESSION:
45|TX|&IMP|| 
46|TX|&IMP||1.  Mild interval increase in size in dominant right lower lobe heterogeneously enhancing partially
47|TX|&IMP||necrotic mass consistent with lung carcinoma.
48|TX|&IMP||2.  Interval increase in both size and number of pulmonary metastatic deposits bilaterally.  The more
49|TX|&IMP||ill-defined ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and involving the lateral basilar segment
50|TX|&IMP||of the left lower lobe are nonspecific and may represent superimposed multifocal inflammatory or
51|TX|&IMP||infectious foci.
52|TX|&IMP||3.  Significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular and right lower neck lymphadenopathy.
53|TX|&IMP|| The previously identified mediastinal and hilar nodes have increased in both size and number.  The
54|TX|&IMP||large infiltrative subcarinal nodal mass has increased and cannot be separated from the esophagus.
55|TX|&IMP||4.  New right hepatic metastatic deposit.  The previously identified lesion closer to the liver dome is
56|TX|&IMP||unchanged compared to MRI study from 09/26/2009 and may represent hepatic hemangioma versus treated

4|TX|&GDT||CT OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST 05/04/2011:
5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT|| 
44|TX|&IMP||IMPRESSION:
45|TX|&IMP|| 
46|TX|&IMP||1.  Mild interval increase in size in dominant right lower lobe heterogeneously enhancing partially
47|TX|&IMP||necrotic mass consistent with lung carcinoma.
48|TX|&IMP||2.  Interval increase in both size and number of pulmonary metastatic deposits bilaterally.  The more
49|TX|&IMP||ill-defined ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and involving the lateral basilar segment
50|TX|&IMP||of the left lower lobe are nonspecific and may represent superimposed multifocal inflammatory or
51|TX|&IMP||infectious foci.
52|TX|&IMP||3.  Significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular and right lower neck lymphadenopathy.
53|TX|&IMP|| The previously identified mediastinal and hilar nodes have increased in both size and number.  The
54|TX|&IMP||large infiltrative subcarinal nodal mass has increased and cannot be separated from the esophagus.
55|TX|&IMP||4.  New right hepatic metastatic deposit.  The previously identified lesion closer to the liver dome is
56|TX|&IMP||unchanged compared to MRI study from 09/26/2009 and may represent hepatic hemangioma versus treated

4|TX|&GDT||CT OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST 05/04/2011:
5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT|| 
44|TX|&IMP||IMPRESSION:
45|TX|&IMP|| 
46|TX|&IMP||1.  Mild interval increase in size in dominant right lower lobe heterogeneously enhancing partially
47|TX|&IMP||necrotic mass consistent with lung carcinoma.
48|TX|&IMP||2.  Interval increase in both size and number of pulmonary metastatic deposits bilaterally.  The more
49|TX|&IMP||ill-defined ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and involving the lateral basilar segment
50|TX|&IMP||of the left lower lobe are nonspecific and may represent superimposed multifocal inflammatory or
51|TX|&IMP||infectious foci.
52|TX|&IMP||3.  Significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular and right lower neck lymphadenopathy.
53|TX|&IMP|| The previously identified mediastinal and hilar nodes have increased in both size and number.  The
54|TX|&IMP||large infiltrative subcarinal nodal mass has increased and cannot be separated from the esophagus.
55|TX|&IMP||4.  New right hepatic metastatic deposit.  The previously identified lesion closer to the liver dome is
56|TX|&IMP||unchanged compared to MRI study from 09/26/2009 and may represent hepatic hemangioma versus treated

4|TX|&GDT||CT OF THE CHEST AND ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST 05/04/2011:
5|TX|&GDT|| 
6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT|| 
44|TX|&IMP||IMPRESSION:
45|TX|&IMP|| 
46|TX|&IMP||1.  Mild interval increase in size in dominant right lower lobe heterogeneously enhancing partially
47|TX|&IMP||necrotic mass consistent with lung carcinoma.
48|TX|&IMP||2.  Interval increase in both size and number of pulmonary metastatic deposits bilaterally.  The more
49|TX|&IMP||ill-defined ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and involving the lateral basilar segment
50|TX|&IMP||of the left lower lobe are nonspecific and may represent superimposed multifocal inflammatory or
51|TX|&IMP||infectious foci.
52|TX|&IMP||3.  Significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular and right lower neck lymphadenopathy.
53|TX|&IMP|| The previously identified mediastinal and hilar nodes have increased in both size and number.  The
54|TX|&IMP||large infiltrative subcarinal nodal mass has increased and cannot be separated from the esophagus.
55|TX|&IMP||4.  New right hepatic metastatic deposit.  The previously identified lesion closer to the liver dome is
56|TX|&IMP||unchanged compared to MRI study from 09/26/2009 and may represent hepatic hemangioma versus treated

6|TX|&GDT||TECHNIQUE:  3 mm sections were obtained from the thoracic inlet through the iliac crest following
7|TX|&GDT||administration of 100 ml of Omnipaque 350.  Coronal and sagittal reformatted images were obtained.
8|TX|&GDT|| 
9|TX|&GDT||CT CHEST:  A right supraclavicular node on image #8 measures 1.5 x 1.9 cm as compared to previous where
10|TX|&GDT||it measured 1.0 x 1.3 cm.  Just medial to this a nodal lesion along the right IJ chain measures 1.9 x
11|TX|&GDT||2.2 cm compared to 0.8 x 1.6 cm.  There may be a new small metastatic node within the right posterior
12|TX|&GDT||cervical triangle measuring 5 mm on image #4.
13|TX|&GDT|| 
14|TX|&GDT||Abnormally enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy overall appears to have progressed.  A
15|TX|&GDT||right-sided superior mediastinal node measures 1.6 x 1.8 cm as compared to 1.5 x 1.8 cm.  Multiple small
16|TX|&GDT||paratracheal nodes are identified.  A dominant partially necrotic infiltrative subcarinal mass measures
17|TX|&GDT||2.4 x 5.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 3.9 cm.  Bilateral small hilar nodes are evident.  A right hilar node
18|TX|&GDT||measures 1.2 x 1.5 cm compared to 0.6 x 0.7 cm.  A right infrahilar nodal lesion has developed in the
19|TX|&GDT||interval measuring 1.3 x 2.1 cm on image #55.
20|TX|&GDT|| 
21|TX|&GDT||The dominant right lower lobe mass measures 2.6 x 3.2 cm compared to 2.4 x 2.8 cm.  A new nodule has
22|TX|&GDT||developed caudal to this near the costophrenic gutter measuring 1.0 x 1.5 cm.
23|TX|&GDT|| 
24|TX|&GDT||Upper lobe predominant bullous emphysema is identified.  A new punctate nodule is noted within the right
25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly
41|TX|&GDT||enlarged upper abdominal nodes.  The bowel pattern does not appear to be obstructive.  A right upper
42|TX|&GDT||chest Mediport device is in place.  No acute or suspicious osseous lesion noted.
43|TX|&GDT||

25|TX|&GDT||upper lobe on image #36 measuring 4 mm.  There are 2 nodules in the superior segment right lower lobe. 
26|TX|&GDT||The medial of the 2 measures 7 mm in diameter as compared to 5 mm.
27|TX|&GDT|| 
28|TX|&GDT||A new subpleural nodule involving the left lower lobe on image #73 measures 4 mm.  A left apical nodule
29|TX|&GDT||has developed on image #13 measuring 5 mm.  A medially located nodule is also noted measuring 6 mm in
30|TX|&GDT||diameter.  Multiple additional subcentimeter nodules are noted within the left upper lobe.  There are
31|TX|&GDT||also more ill-defined ground-glass opacities noted more caudally within the left upper lobe and lingula
32|TX|&GDT||on images #47 through 52 as well as involving the lateral basilar segment of the left lower lobe on
33|TX|&GDT||images #52 and 56.
34|TX|&GDT|| 
35|TX|&GDT||CT ABDOMEN:  The previously noted lesion near the liver dome is unchanged in size.  This measures 1.1 x
36|TX|&GDT||1.4 cm.  On the remote MRI study from 09/26/2009 it measured 1.4 x 1.6 cm.  There is however a new
37|TX|&GDT||rim-enhancing hypodense lesion within the right hepatic lobe not seen on MRI study.  This measures 1.4 x
38|TX|&GDT||1.6 cm.
39|TX|&GDT|| 
40|TX|&GDT||The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable.  No significantly

48|TX|&IMP||2.  Interval increase in both size and number of pulmonary metastatic deposits bilaterally.  The more
49|TX|&IMP||ill-defined ground-glass opacities within the left upper lobe and involving the lateral basilar segment
50|TX|&IMP||of the left lower lobe are nonspecific and may represent superimposed multifocal inflammatory or
51|TX|&IMP||infectious foci.
52|TX|&IMP||3.  Significant interval increase in size of right supraclavicular and right lower neck lymphadenopathy.
53|TX|&IMP|| The previously identified mediastinal and hilar nodes have increased in both size and number.  The
54|TX|&IMP||large infiltrative subcarinal nodal mass has increased and cannot be separated from the esophagus.
55|TX|&IMP||4.  New right hepatic metastatic deposit.  The previously identified lesion closer to the liver dome is
56|TX|&IMP||unchanged compared to MRI study from 09/26/2009 and may represent hepatic hemangioma versus treated
